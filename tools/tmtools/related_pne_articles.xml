**What it does**

This tool provides related protein, nucleic acid and enzyme (PNE) article(s) for MEDLINE abstract(s).

PNE is a journal of Japan publishing review articles in all aspects of biology, and all articles in PNE are written in Japanese.

To recognize representative keyword(s) in MEDLINE abstracts, a biomedical term recognizer is developted by Dr. Chun of DBCLS using FACTA dictionaries of the National Centre for Text Mining (NaCTeM).

To translate representative English keywords in MEDLINE abstracts into Japanese terms, an English-Japanese dictionary developed by the dictionary team in DBCLS was used.

To search PNE articles, a PNE search API developed by the dictionary team in DBCLS was used.
