**What it does**

This tool creates a histogram image of sequence lengths distribution in a given fasta data set file.

**TIP:** Use this tool after clipping your library (with **FASTX Clipper tool**), to visualize the clipping results.

**Output Examples**


In the following library, most sequences are 24-mers to 27-mers. 
This could indicate an abundance of endo-siRNAs (depending of course of what you've tried to sequence in the first place).

In the following library, most sequences are 19,22 or 23-mers. 
This could indicate an abundance of miRNAs (depending of course of what you've tried to sequence in the first place).
